# possum 

Possums are just little angry buddies that would rather fart and play dead than
put up a fight. They're extremely resourceful, making home where ever food,
water and shelter is available. And they're immune to rabies because they're
too cold inside. There's a lot to relate with a possum, especially when it
comes to working with github actions.
